/ The main idea is to check for the new part from left when adding a new digit or change to the number structure like the diff betwee 2000 and 20000
// so at the first i have to exclude the 2 and second i have to exclude the 20 so i have to modulus 1000 at the two cases so i dont need to make them seperate condiditions 
// the number resolved into multible parts and then everytime the funcrtion make recursion on each part from thousands to tens and hundreds.
// 6000000 , 60,000,000 , 600,000,000 at the three cases i have to make modulus 1000 so i dont need seperate conditions
